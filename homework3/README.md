# Public transport analysis

**Description:** This app searches in pregenerated xml "database" for the longest routes of different public transport and 
the route with the maximum stops. 

**How to run:** You need to add to the folder with all cpp and hpp files: pugixml.hpp, pugixml.cpp and pugiconfig.hpp. The latest version
you can download [here](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/tree/master/src). Also you need to change a hardcoded way in filesystem for data.xml
file(main.cpp, line 58) which is in the project folder.
